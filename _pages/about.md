# About

I am a Senior Backend & Data Engineer with 4+ years of experience delivering production-grade systems across enterprise and startup environments.

My core focus is **backend delivery (Spring Boot)** combined with **data engineering and applied ML**, especially for time-series workflows (forecasting, anomaly detection) and real-world integration (APIs, pipelines, monitoring).

**Current focus:** remote freelance missions, part-time (evenings/weekends), long-running engagements preferred.
