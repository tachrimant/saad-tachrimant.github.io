<div class="about-content">

## Who I am

I'm a **Senior Backend & Data Engineer** with **4+ years** of experience delivering production-grade systems across enterprise and startup environments.

My core strength lies in translating complex business problems into scalable, reliable technical solutions. I specialize in:

- **Backend architecture** (Spring Boot microservices, REST APIs, async workflows)
- **Data engineering** (pipelines, time-series processing, quality assurance)
- **Applied AI/ML** (forecasting, anomaly detection, edge deployment)

---

## What drives me

I'm drawn to **end-to-end ownership** — taking a problem from conception to production monitoring. I excel at:

- ✓ Designing systems that *actually scale* under real-world constraints
- ✓ Building data pipelines that respect both **accuracy** and **reliability**
- ✓ Deploying AI at the **edge**, not just in notebooks
- ✓ Writing code that others can maintain and extend
- ✓ Communicating technical decisions to diverse teams

---

## Current focus

🎯 **Remote freelance missions** | Part-time (Evenings & Weekends) | Long-term engagements preferred

I'm actively seeking opportunities where:
- You need a **backend engineer** who understands data pipelines and ML
- The work requires **depth** over breadth
- You value **clear communication** and **reliable delivery**

---

## Experience highlights

- **4+ years** of production experience (backend, data, AI)
- **2 live platforms** handling real users and transactions
- **1 distributed edge AI system** deployed on 50+ Raspberry Pi devices
- **1 open dataset** used for research in building thermal modeling
